# GEO4300 lab exercise templates (2023)

These are exercise templates for GEO4300/9300 Geophysical Data Science. The step-by-step guidance:

- Install python and configure your development environment. You may also use the remote resource (See Lab_technique_Q&A.pdf)
- Get the exercise templates:

```
$ cd <your-dir>
$ git clone https://github.com/liuh886/GEO4300_2023.git
```

Or you can also download it from here or Canvas.

- Finish assignment and deliver the exercise.
